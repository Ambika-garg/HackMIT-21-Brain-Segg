It's time to expose the big lie, parading around like the truth. I call Mr. Brain Tumor to stand and charge him with for death of thousands of people every year. I know we don't have much time so please don't mind and allow us to show you how to detect this guy. Are you stunned yet, we called us homo sapiens meaning wise man, is a man so wise, it is good to be smart but not smart for your good. Yes, we have split the atom, build clever machines, junk food to it but this wisdom also gave us diseases like brain tumors, When wisdom speaks nature listens and today wisdom will speak for Tumor.

## General Info

The theme at HACKMIT-21 was to use technology to improve accessibility by finding a creative solution to benefit the lives in healthcare. We want to make brain tumor testing easy and more accesible across the world to study their MRI within 300 seconds and also provide professional help if needed.So we designed this tool uisng Deep Learning which results in a Brain Tumor Segmentar 24*7 for every human.

## Setup

Use Command Prompt to set up the environment by using requirments.txt and GPU is required to run the model

```bash
pip install -r requirments.txt
```

To run server 

```bash
python manager.py runserver
```

This will help you in installing all the libraries required for the project.

## Features
We trained the HGG and LGG models on 35 patients both for HGG and LGG model with 120 epochs. We used https://github.com/lescientifik/open_brats2020 pipeline.

The maximum dice score achieved in LGG for a particular patient was 0.8488 and in the same sensitivity was 0.9922 and the specificity was 0.9966

The maximum dice score achieved in HGG for a particular patient was 0.9217 and in the same sensitivity was 0.9816 and specificity was 0.9979. 

## Features that can be added:

Deploy the project on the cloud and create an API for using it.
Also, incorporate a classification pipeline to classify between HGG and LGG
Increase the speed and dice scores for better results.
Add more training data.

## Status
