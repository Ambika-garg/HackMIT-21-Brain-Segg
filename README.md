It's time to expose the big lie, parading around like the truth. I call Mr. Brain Tumor to stand and charge him with for death of thousands of people every year. I know we don't have much time so please don't mind and allow us to show you how to detect this guy. Are you stunned yet, we called us homo sapiens meaning wise man, is a man so wise, it is good to be smart but not smart for your good. Yes, we have split the atom, build clever machines, junk food to it but this wisdom also gave us diseases like brain tumors, When wisdom speaks nature listens and today wisdom will speak for Tumor.

## General Info

The theme at HACKMIT-21 was to use technology to improve accessibilty by finding a creative solution to benefit the lives in healthcare.We want to make it easy for 24000 Brain cancer people across the world to study their MRI within 300 seconds and also provide professional help if needed ,So we designed this software and Machine Learning model as Brain Tumor Segmentar 24*7 for every human.

## Setup

Use Command Prompt to setup the environment by using requirment.txt and GPU is required to run model

```bash
pip install -r requirment.txt
```

To run server 

```bash
  python manager.py runserver
```

This will help you in installing all the libraries required for the project

  
## Features

The project is: finished. You can see our final submission here. If you would like us to implement the project end to end for you please book a session.

The maximum dice score achieved in LGG MRI was 0.8488 and in the same case density was 0.9922 and the specificity was 0.9966
