It's time to expose the big lie ,prading around like the truth.I call Mr. Brain Tumor to stand and charge him with for death of thousand of people every year .I know we don't have much time so please don't mind and allow us to show you how to detect this guy 
.Are you stund yet ,we called us homo sapean meaing wise man ,is man really so wise ,it good to be smart but not smart for your own good. Yes we have split the atom ,build clever machine ,junk food to it but these wisdom also gave us disease like brain tumor,When wisdom speaks natures listens and today wisdom will speak for Tumor.

## General Info

The theme at HACKMIT-21 was to use technology to improve accessibilty by finding a creative solution to benefit the lives in healthcare.We want to make it easy for 24000 Brain cancer people across the world to study their MRI within 300 seconds and also provide professional help if needed ,So we designed this software and Machine Learning model as Brain Tumor Segmentar 24*7 for every human.

## Setup

Use Command Promot to setup the environment by using requirment.txt and GPU is required to run model

```bash
pip install -r requirment.txt
```

To run server 

```bash
  python manager.py runserver
```

This will help you in installing all the libraries required for the project

  
## Features

The maximum dice score achived in LGG MRI was 0.8488 and in same case sensity was 0.9922 and the specificity was 0.9966

Features that can be added:

    Deploy the project on cloud and create and API for using it.
fsgfg

    Increase the vocabulary of our model 
fdgfg

    Incorporate feedback mechanisim to make the model more rebust
asddf

    Add more Traning data
